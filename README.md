# European-schools-scraper
Hello. This scipt outputs either .csv or .xlsx files with a data of all european schools from:
https://www.iss.edu/Resources-Center/schools-explore-list/Schools-by-Region/Schools-in-Europe-Eastern-Europe
I've also converted .csv file into.sql file.
Result may have something like 'https://' in a site cell, but this happens due to the bad formatting of iss.edu.
